## D-001: Spec-Driven Development with Comprehensive BRDs

**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Agent:** BSA
**Category:** Process
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The project needed detailed specifications to enable AI-assisted implementation with GitHub Copilot. Traditional BRDs were too high-level and didn't include the technical details needed for copy-paste implementation.

### Decision
Create 19 comprehensive BRDs (BRD-00 to BRD-18) in strict implementation order with:
- Complete file structures with paths
- Copy-paste ready code blocks
- Alembic migrations
- Pydantic models
- React components
- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin format
- Implementation checklists

### Consequences
- Development will follow strict sequence
- Each BRD is self-contained for implementation
- Code can be directly copied from BRDs
- Reduces ambiguity and decision-making during coding

### Artifacts Created
- 19 BRDs in `docs/implementation-phase/brds/`
- Updated knowledge base index
- Enhanced BRD template in memory bank
