## D-002: BRD-00 Implementation — Project Setup

**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Agent:** Orchestrator
**Category:** Implementation
**Status:** Completed

### Context
First implementation in the Novum project. Needed to establish the complete folder structure and tooling configuration for both backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React/Vite).

### Decision
Implement BRD-00 as the foundation for all subsequent BRDs:
- Backend: Python 3.12 + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + Alembic
- Frontend: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 (plugin, no config)
- Full atomic design structure for components

### Consequences
- All subsequent BRDs can build on this foundation
- Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` (not v3 directives)
- Path aliases configured via `vite-tsconfig-paths`
- Agent tooling updated to include full toolset for subagents

### Artifacts Created
- `backend/` complete structure (pyproject.toml, app/, alembic/, tests/)
- `frontend/` complete structure (package.json, src/, components/, lib/)
- `scripts/` (dev.ps1, export_types.py)
- Implementation plan: `docs/implementation-phase/implementation-plans/IP-00-project-setup.md`

## D-001: Spec-Driven Development with Comprehensive BRDs

**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Agent:** BSA
**Category:** Process
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The project needed detailed specifications to enable AI-assisted implementation with GitHub Copilot. Traditional BRDs were too high-level and didn't include the technical details needed for copy-paste implementation.

### Decision
Create 19 comprehensive BRDs (BRD-00 to BRD-18) in strict implementation order with:
- Complete file structures with paths
- Copy-paste ready code blocks
- Alembic migrations
- Pydantic models
- React components
- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin format
- Implementation checklists

### Consequences
- Development will follow strict sequence
- Each BRD is self-contained for implementation
- Code can be directly copied from BRDs
- Reduces ambiguity and decision-making during coding

### Artifacts Created
- 19 BRDs in `docs/implementation-phase/brds/`
- Updated knowledge base index
- Enhanced BRD template in memory bank

## How to Add Decisions

1. Increment the decision number (D-001, D-002, etc.)
2. Fill out the template completely
3. Update the "Total Decisions" count above
4. Add to the appropriate category section
5. Update the "Recent Decisions" section (keep last 5)
